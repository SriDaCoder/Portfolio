              Hello! My name is Srinihas Akkineni, and I am a high school student with a passion for coding and technology. I have been programming for several years now, and I enjoy creating projects that solve real-world problems. In addition to coding, I also have interests in literature and martial arts. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in my skills. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
